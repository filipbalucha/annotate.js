Your library is excellent and you did some great work.

(old comment:) You mention a lot of excellent features, and the only reason you did not get a perfect score for Library Features and Functionality is because you have not shown evidence of any of these features in the current state of the library (even as alpha features). But everything else is very well organized and visually professional. Honestly, once you implement these remaining features, you're golden. This is the kind of library I would use when creating a website.

(update:) I changed my mind and gave you 5/5 because you have shown very well-designed sketches of these features in your proposal. From an Alpha release perspective, this is definitely enough. Great job!
